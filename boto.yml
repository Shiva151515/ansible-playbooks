creating ec2 instance using ansible playbook:

    1. We are going to access aws cloud using IAM role
    2. Using IAM role is more secure option
    
Prerequisites:

    1. ansible needs to be installed and also boto needs to be installed on centos ec2 instance

Install boto framework - AWS SDK: 

    1.command : sudo pip install boto boto3
    ansible will access AWS resources using boto SDK
    if you want to access AWS services using python so you should use boto framework because ansible written in python language.
    
    2.command: sudo yum install python-boto -y
    
    3.command: pip list | grep boto
    
    If boto is installed on your system, the output of the command will show the package name, version, and other information. 
    
    For example:   boto3               1.18.17
                   botocore            1.21.17
    
    : Note that pip is the package installer for Python and pip list shows a list of packages installed on your system via pip. The grep command is used to filter the output of pip list and only show lines that contain the string "boto".
    
    
    2. Make sure you create an IAM role with AmazonEc2 full access policy and attach the role to ec2 instance
