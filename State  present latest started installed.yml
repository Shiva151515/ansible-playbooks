In Ansible, the following are common states that can be applied to a resource:

1.present: This state ensures that a resource exists in its desired state. For example, if you want to ensure that a package is installed on a server, 
         you would use the present state.
         

2.latest: This state ensures that a resource is updated to the latest available version. For example, 
        if you want to ensure that a package is always up-to-date, you would use the latest state.
        

3.installed: This state ensures that a package is installed on a server. This state is similar to present, but is specific to packages.


4.updated: This state ensures that a package is updated to the latest available version. This state is similar to latest, but is specific to packages.


5.absent: This state ensures that a resource does not exist on a server. For example, 
          if you want to ensure that a package is not installed on a server, you would use the absent state.
          

6.started: This state ensures that a service is started on a server. For example, if you want to ensure that the Apache web server is running, 
           you would use the started state.
           

7.stopped: This state ensures that a service is stopped on a server. For example, if you want to ensure that the Apache web server is stopped, 
           you would use the stopped state.
           

8.restarted: This state ensures that a service is restarted on a server. For example, if you want to restart the Apache web server, 
            you would use the restarted state.
            

9.reloaded: This state ensures that a service is reloaded on a server. For example, 
            if you want to reload the configuration of the Apache web server without restarting it, you would use the reloaded state.
