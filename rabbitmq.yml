RabbitMQ is a message broker that allows different software applications and services to communicate with each other by exchanging messages

The main purpose of RabbitMQ server is to facilitate communication between distributed systems by routing messages from producers to consumers based on specific criteria.


Some of the common use cases for RabbitMQ server include:

    1.Microservices architecture: RabbitMQ can be used to coordinate communication between microservices in a distributed system. Each microservice can produce and consume messages from RabbitMQ, which acts as a message broker.
    
    2.Remote procedure calls: RabbitMQ can be used to implement remote procedure calls (RPCs) where a client can invoke a method on a remote server by sending a message to RabbitMQ.
